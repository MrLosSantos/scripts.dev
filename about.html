I got to witness the end of some technologies and the advent of other technologies. The first computer language I learned was HTML - back when MySpace was a thing and you could customize profiles by embedding HTML. This happened at the age of 12. After buffing up a bit on HTML in high school, my first year of college unfolded and Java was the second computer language I learned. Ever since then, I've considered myself devoted to computer science. ❤";
